AI-Driven Dynamic Traffic Management System (DTMS)

Project Overview:

This project focuses on developing an AI-driven Dynamic Traffic Management System (DTMS) aimed at reducing urban traffic congestion, minimizing environmental impact, and improving overall mobility in smart cities.

By leveraging AI algorithms and real-time data analytics, the DTMS will dynamically adjust traffic signals and provide predictive insights for effective traffic management.

Key Features:

Real-time Signal Adjustment: Adaptive traffic signals based on live traffic data

Predictive Analytics: Forecasting traffic hotspots to prevent bottlenecks

Alternate Route Suggestions: Route optimization via mobile applications

Centralized Dashboard: Insights and control for traffic authorities

Implementation Phases:

Phase 1 - Research & Development:

Collection of traffic data and AI model training using historical data and IoT sensors

Phase 2 - Pilot Deployment:
